# ‚ùì Why do we need a token?

Introducing a token to our ecosystem provides a unique identity and sense of direction for our program. As is the case with many other crypto projects, our token will be utilized as a means of providing rewards to our users in exchange for exposure.

Our token distribution will be done mostly through NFTs. By using this approach, we can decrease the supply in concordance with the NFTs sold thus keeping the inflation low by burning the unsold Token NFTs. It will help us have a fair launch with token utility from day 1.

The GCH token will serve as a critical component of our ecosystem, providing a way for our users to earn rewards and interact with our program more effectively. As users earn tokens through completing quests and other tasks, they'll be able to use them to unlock additional benefits, access new features, and receive other incentives.

Furthermore, the token will be integrated with the other components of our Hub, such as the Reward Pool and Global Vault. Ultimately, the token serves as a means of building a stronger and more engaged community, one that is incentivized to participate actively and productively in our program, and that is motivated to help us achieve our goals and vision.\
