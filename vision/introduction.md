# üè≥ Introduction

Questing platforms have become the norm in achieving user exposure and engagement.\
\
Our initial project iteration centered around farming and rewarding engagement across diverse platforms. However, the outcomes fell short of our expectations, revealing two critical issues in questing platforms: Bots and the lack of User Gratification. Without robust bot protection and a fair reward system, users were left without the incentive to continue questing, leading to fatigue and disengagement.\


\
**The Dilemma:**\
\
Consider this: How many quests have you undertaken with the hope of substantial rewards, only to be disappointed? How many OAT/NFTs have been claimed, only to serve as digital artifacts devoid of real value? How many times have you competed against bots, stealing all the rewards and leaving you empty-handed?\
The diminishing engagement on existing platforms is indicative of a fundamental flaw ‚Äì the absence of a compelling reward structure and fair distribution.\


\
**Our Vision:**\
\
In response to these challenges, we embarked on a journey with a clear vision: to revolutionize the questing experience by addressing the fundamental issues of bots, inadequate rewards and unfair distribution. Our innovative proof-of-work quest mining app represents a pioneering solution.\


1. **Every Action is a Mining Event:** Our system treats every user action as a mining event, ensuring that users can continuously earn rewards for their engagement.
2. **Proof-of-Work Quest Mining DApp:** The first-of-its-kind decentralized application (DApp) introduces a novel approach to questing, reshaping the dynamics by rewarding every action.
3. **Mining Pool Feature:** Creators can instantly tap into millions of users without the need to build a community first. Exposure is no longer tied to community size.
4. **Fair Reward System:** The two-token reward system addresses user fragmentation, boosts overall engagement, and ensures that everyone can earn from proof-of-work quests. No luck involved ‚Äì the more you work, the more you earn.\

   We are not just redefining questing platforms, we are setting new standards. Say goodbye to disappointments, empty-handed quests, and unfair competition. Join us as we pave the way for a questing experience where every action counts and every user is truly rewarded.&#x20;
