# üçî Owners Revenue

We are committed to the success of the Hub so our revenue will come exclusively from renting channels inside the Projects Showroom which will be free until there is enough traffic to sustain it.\
It's essential to note that the rental system has nothing to do with the Reward System set in place, and Hub Owners will never touch users' rewards.\
\
We will introduce a flat fee per week for renting the channels that will go towards the Hub Owners. The fee will always be lower than the rewards provided for the community and will not impede the Hub's growth.
