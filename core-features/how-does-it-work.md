# ℹ How does it work?

Step 1 involves renting a space within the Projects Showroom. Our Showroom provides a safe space for credible and promising projects to flourish, with access to a large and engaged user base. By joining our Hub, projects gain access to our platform's resources and organic growth mechanics, allowing them to focus on building their product while we handle the marketing and exposure.

Step 2 involves providing rewards to the Reward Pool. By contributing to the pool, projects are incentivizing users to engage with their project, creating a loyal and active user base. 40% of the rewards generated through this mechanism are distributed to users, ensuring that our platform is always rewarding those who engage and provide exposure. The next 50% of rewards generated are allocated to the Global Vault and the last 10% will be burned.

Step 3 marks the stage where projects are ready for social exposure. With a dedicated channel in our Showroom and access to our large user base, projects can begin to engage with our community and grow their brand. Through our custom quests and events, projects can incentivize engagement and make their project known.

The Global Vault serves as a Treasury for our ecosystem. By allocating 50% of rewards generated to the Vault, we ensure that our [Global Gateway NFT](../tokenomics/the-global-gateway-nft.md) holders will always be rewarded for their long term engagement.

Our platform's components work together to create a unique and organic ecosystem that supports credible and promising projects while rewarding users for their engagement. By joining our Hub, projects gain access to a large and engaged user base while users gain access to the best and most promising projects in the crypto market.\
