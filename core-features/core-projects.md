# üóù Core Projects

Core Projects are essential partners that form a vital part of our program's identity, contributing significant value to our Hub. These partners enjoy permanent, dedicated channels inside the Hub, ensuring that they receive maximum exposure to our community. These channels will never be hidden and will have access to the full range of services provided by the Hub, entirely free of charge.\
With 10% of the GCH fee dedicated to them, the Core Projects will be self-sustainable. They won't have to provide rewards to participate in events as we will use the collected fee.&#x20;

Core Projects are carefully selected partners who share our vision and mission, and who can provide additional value to our users. By partnering with Core Projects, we can offer our users access to additional resources, tools, and services that complement our core offering, providing a more comprehensive and complete experience.

We take great care in selecting Core Projects to ensure that they align with our values and priorities. \
If you are interested in becoming a Core Project partner, please contact us for more information. We are always open to new partnerships that can help us provide more value to our users and strengthen our program's overall offering.
