# üèß Global Vault



1. **Global Vault:**
   * A secure and transparent treasury designed to hold long-term funds for the project.
2. **Token Mined Allocation:**
   * A percentage of the total tokens mined on the platform is allocated to the Global Vault. This allocation is intended to provide a reserve for the project's future development.
3. **Monthly Token Buybacks and Burns:**
   * Designed to enhance the value of our native token (GCH) through a strategic use of profits. We allocate a portion of our monthly earnings for token buybacks and burns. Token buybacks involve repurchasing GCH tokens from the market, a practice known to increase token value by reducing the circulating supply. Only a % of buy-back tokens are burned.
4. **Use of Funds:**
   * The funds stored in the Global Vault, as well as those obtained through token buybacks, will be utilized for various purposes:
     * Marketing: Promoting the project to increase awareness and user adoption.
     * Development: Enhancing and expanding the project's features and capabilities.
     * Listings: Possibly securing listings on additional cryptocurrency exchanges to increase liquidity and accessibility.
     * Liquidity: Adding liquidity to decentralized exchanges to improve market stability and enable smoother trading
     * Airdrops for Global Gateway NFT holders
