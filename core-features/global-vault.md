# üèß Global Vault

The Global Vault is a secure and transparent Treasury for long-term funds, with its own address and smart contract that can be tracked by anyone. It will be funded by a portion of the fees charged by the program, with 50% of these fees directed into the Vault.

The Vault is designed to support the long-term growth and sustainability of our Global Gateway NFT.\
By holding the [**Global Gateway NFT**](../tokenomics/the-global-gateway-nft.md), each user will share a % of the vault funds. \
Users can vote on releasing a % of the vault funds each quarter that will be shared between all NFT holders. The vault can never be depleted and any actions conducted by bad actors will not be taken into consideration.\
All the decisions concerning the Vault funds will be tied to voting! Each NFT will equal 1 vote.

Higher the value of our Vault, the higher the value of the OG NFT on the secondary market. Giving users the option to cash out by selling their NFT and share in the treasury, thus not having to wait for quarterly percentage shares.

To start the Global Vault, we are allocating **400 OG NFTs** that can be slowly sold over time and **500K** GCH tokens(locked for 12 months)\
Additional sustainable income streams will be directed into the Vault. To be revealed soon.\


Overall, the Global Vault is an essential component of the project's long-term strategy, providing a secure and transparent repository for funds ensuring the program's sustainable growth and success.\
