# üè≥ Introduction

Currently, the crypto market boasts over 20,000 projects, with many others not even making it to the boards. Regrettably, the majority of these projects consist of scams, meme coins, and rug pulls, lacking any real usability. For new users, identifying worthy projects can be a tedious and overwhelming process, while keeping up with multiple communities can quickly become a nightmare. Users may miss out on crucial news and events, leading to frustration and eventual disengagement from the crypto scene.

To address this issue, we have developed a solution by creating GlobalCryptoHub. A place where the most promising projects in the crypto market can take the spotlight and engage with our community.\
Our users have access to a comprehensive review of each project and can stay informed about the latest news and events, all under one roof. We provide chat rooms that encourage open expression of opinions on the projects without any fear of repercussion. Additionally, our Hub rewards users for their social engagement with the incubated projects through Zealy/Galxe quests.

Marketing is a significant aspect of any project's lifespan, as even the best product can fail without adequate exposure. While the ideal scenario would be to focus on building the best product and leave the marketing to experts, the reality of the crypto scene is different. Every project requires a strong community to survive, and with so many projects emerging each day, it's challenging to create one. However, GlobalCryptoHub has overcome this challenge by creating a credible Hub that incubates only the best projects and offers a high variety of social exposure quests and events.&#x20;
