# ⚖ Hub Overwiew

We are a marketing Hub, offering exposure to projects by rewarding the community. \
The Hub is built around our Discord server. It's easily manageable and structured so every new user and project can understand it at first glance.\
We have developed a series of concepts that will help projects and users achieve their respective goals: exposure and rewards. \
\
Each new project will be evaluated by our team to mitigate the scam risk. \
After a full review, they will be given the Tenant status and will be approved to rent a channel for exposure in the [Projects Showroom](../core-features/projects-showroom.md), where they will be provided with a dedicated channel and in-depth details about their project. We will create a series of quests using the Zealy/Galxe platform. \
Quests like Join Discord/Join Telegram/Follow Twitter/Insta/Medium will tremendously boost your channel numbers while Quiz Quests will help the community learn about your project.\
\
20% of the collected rent will be used for Team and Marketing while the other 80% will be used to buyback [GCH](../tokenomics/token-details.md) from the open market and use it as rewards towards the community.\
The GCH is Hub's token with a total supply of 6.000.000. \
\
40% of the bought CGH will go towards the [Reward Pool](../core-features/reward-pool.md) for users to share. After completing the above quests each user will be able to claim a discord role based on which they will be rewarded.\
\
50% will go towards the [Global Vault](../core-features/global-vault.md), which will act as a treasury owned by the Global Gateway NFT holders.\
\
10% will be used to burn the GCH tokens incentivizing users to rather hold than sell. \
